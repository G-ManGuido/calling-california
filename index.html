                    Last year, nearly 2 million acres were devastated by the deadliest, most destructive wildfires in
                    California history.

                <p>Stuck in the middle.</p>
                <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the
                    California Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters will be available for purchase at our
                    exclusive pop-up shop during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose
                    what amount to donate. All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities that
                    are still displaced.

                <h2>The Golden Bear</h2>
                <p class="middle">This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations
                    and come out stronger than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like
                    the California poppy.</p>

                <h2>The Poppy Bear</h2>
                <p class="middle">This design is inspired by the quote ‘grow through what you go through’ and represents
                    the strength of Californians and how we will continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
